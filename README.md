# Atlas Headphones

This project is a responsive website for a fictitious headphone company, Atlas Headphones. The website was created as part of a school project to test our ability to accurately replicate a design provided in a Figma file. The goal was to maintain the quality of the design across all device sizes, from mobile to desktop.

## Project Overview

The website includes several sections:

- A header with a navigation menu
- A main section with details about what the company does, their results, and a contact form
- A footer with social media links and copyright information

Each section is fully responsive and adjusts to fit the screen size of the device it's viewed on.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (for the navigation menu)

## Live site
